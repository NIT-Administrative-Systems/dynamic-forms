# ADO Competitive Applications [![Dev Deployment](https://github.com/NIT-Administrative-Systems/competitive-applications/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/NIT-Administrative-Systems/competitive-applications/actions/workflows/deploy.yml)
The Competitive Applications system is a workflow system for running contests: people apply to receive a finite resource, their applications are rated, and the best applications win.

In practice, this is used for undergraduate research grants.

## Running the App
todo

```sh

# You can run this to generate a file that'll give your IDE auto-complete data for columns on your ELoquent models
# Your DB needs to be set up & you need an IDE that supports _ide_helper_models.php (VS Code with PHP Intelliphense works)
$ php artisan ide-helper:models -N
```
